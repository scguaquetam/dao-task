Start your decentralized contribution path with Axia.
## Vision
Web3 representation and meritocracy with flexible and agile task management systems
## Description
Axia is designed to help teams and DAO users efficiently organize, track, and complete tasks. With a focus on visualization and collaboration, the board enables agile and effective task management.

Meritocracy is possible with an ID verifier that assigns a role in your DAO.

And it is super necessary have a voice and vote if you disagree with a task's score by choosing the members of the Moderators Committee, who will transparently resolve disputes.

On Connect: First a user connects, and the user can create an organization as admin, or join as a contributor to an existing DAO, for which they must be verified with Polygon ID as a member of that DAO. Also, admin are the only ones that can get claim links to send to their DAO members to join.

How does it work? This dApp is designed to help teams and DAO users efficiently organize, track, and complete tasks. With a focus on visualization and collaboration, the board enables agile and effective task management.

If you are an Admin:

1. Add, edit, and delete columns.
2. Create a board from scratch.
3. Add, edit, and delete columns or categories.
4. Create, edit, and delete cards.
5. Add descriptions and requirements to the cards.
6. Accept applications for tasks from other team members.
7. Descriptions and comments on cards.
8. Apply to tasks.
9. Validate due dates, and more.
10. Invite external members to join the team.

If you are a Contributor (an admin must give you a Credential):

1. Apply to tasks.
2. Choose members of the Moderators Committee.
3. Upload your contributions.
4. Initiate a dispute to change a task's score.

If you are a Moderator (an admin must invite you):

1. Select completed bounties.
2. Resolve disputes within 72 hours.

## Next steps for Axia:
1. Integrate Push Protocol -Allow more collaboration -Contribution history or Proof of Work NFT, that allows identifying outstanding contributors for its development within the DAOs.
